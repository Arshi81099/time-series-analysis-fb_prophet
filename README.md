# **Time Series Analysis using fbprophet**

### **Overview**
This project demonstrates a detailed **time series analysis** using **Facebook Prophet (fbprophet)**, a robust tool for forecasting time series data. The main focus is on modeling trends and seasonality to predict future values based on historical data.

### **Key Features**
- **Data Preprocessing**: The notebook begins with cleaning and structuring the time series data to prepare it for modeling.
- **Model Building**: Using the `fbprophet` library, the time series data is modeled to capture seasonal trends, daily/weekly fluctuations, and overall trends.
- **Forecasting**: Future projections are made based on historical patterns, allowing for actionable insights.
- **Visualizations**: Multiple plots are generated to illustrate:
  - Seasonal decomposition
  - Forecast trends
  - Uncertainty intervals
  - Trend and seasonality components

### **Libraries Used**
- `fbprophet`: For time series forecasting.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `matplotlib`/`plotly`: For data visualization.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.

### **Getting Started**
To run the notebook locally, ensure the following dependencies are installed:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy plotly fbprophet
```

### **Running the Notebook**
1. Load the notebook file: `fbprophet-time-series-analysis.ipynb`.
2. Ensure the time series dataset is available and correctly formatted (with a date column and values to forecast).
3. Follow the steps in the notebook:
   - Data preprocessing and exploration.
   - Model fitting and validation.
   - Visualizing forecast results.

### **Output**
The final output includes forecasted values with trends and seasonal components, along with confidence intervals.

### **Use Cases**
- **Sales Forecasting**: Predict future sales based on historical data, adjusting for holidays and promotions.
- **Weather Predictions**: Model seasonal trends in temperature, humidity, etc.
- **Website Traffic**: Forecast the number of visitors to a website based on past activity.

### **Why fbprophet?**
- **Ease of Use**: fbprophet is simple to implement and works well with various time series data, even when the data has gaps or missing values.
- **Interpretability**: Clear and interpretable results, including seasonality breakdown and trends.
- **Accuracy**: Effective for capturing important patterns such as yearly seasonality or holiday effects.
